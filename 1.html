  <p style="margin-top:40px"><strong>When I was a young boy,</strong> my father took me in to the city to see a marching band.<br>
  He said,<br>
  "Son when you grow up, would you be the saviour of the broken, the beaten and the damned."
  He said,<br>
  "Will you defeat them? Your demons and all the non-believers,the plans that they have made?
  Because one day I'll leave you a phantom to lead you in the summer, to join the black parade."
