    What if, what if we run away?
    What if, what if we left today?
    What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
    And what if, what if we're hard to find?
    What if, what if we lost our minds?
    What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?
    And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
    And the stars exploding, weâ€™ll be fireproof
    My youth, my youth is yours
    Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
    My youth, my youth is yours
    Runaway now and forevermore
    My youth, my youth is yours
    A truth so loud you can't ignore
    My youth, my youth, my youth
    My youth is yours
    My youth is yours
    My youth is yours
    My youth is yours
    What if, what if we start to drive?
    What if, what if we close our eyes?
    What if we're speeding through red lights into paradise?
    'Cause we've no time for getting old
    Mortal body, timeless souls
    Cross your fingers, here we go
    Oh oh oh oh
    And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
    And when the lights start flashing, flashing, flashing
    And when the lights start flashing
    My youth, my youth is yours
    Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
    My youth, my youth is yours
    Runaway now and forevermore
    My youth, my youth is yours
    A truth so loud you can't ignore
    My youth, my youth, my youth
    My youth is yours
    My youth is yours
    My youth is yours
    My youth is yours
